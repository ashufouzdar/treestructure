# treestructure
 A small utility program that can help in visualizing the existing directory structure in terms of graphs
 
 If you've ever designed a build setup for any existing project, you've encountered the daunting task of visualizing the project structure. Sometimes, you may have created a sketch to represent the same. During my experience with build terminologies, I researched for a simple tool to generate a visual representation of the existing project layout. Luckily, I found some utilities, but most of them were commercial utilities. Or I can say, I was not able to find such a free utility. This was the inception of this small utility. I had an idea of recursively processing the directory tree, but the problem was the rendering in a graphical manner. After toilsome efforts, I found a free toolkit called GraphWiz. This toolkit was composed of many utilities to render many kinds of graphs. Here, I was only interested in a directed graph creation utility. GraphWiz has such a utility, namely Dot. Dot requires a simple input file that is written using a Dot specific syntax (described later), and renders the output in various formats including GIF, JPG, and PNG.
